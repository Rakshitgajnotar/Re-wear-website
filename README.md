👕 ReWear – Clothing Exchange Platform
Overview

ReWear is a web-based platform that promotes sustainable fashion by enabling users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. Instead of discarding wearable garments, users can refresh their wardrobe in an eco-friendly way while reducing textile waste.

✨ Features

ReWear provides secure authentication with email and password, ensuring a safe experience for all users. The platform features a clean landing page with clear calls-to-action to get started. Each user has a personal dashboard where they can view their profile details, check their points balance, and track uploaded items as well as ongoing or completed swaps.

Users can easily list new clothing items by uploading images and entering key details like title, description, category, size, type, and condition. Each item has a dedicated detail page with an image gallery, uploader information, availability status, and options to either request a swap or redeem using points.

To keep the platform reliable and community-friendly, an admin panel allows administrators to review and approve new listings, remove inappropriate content, and manage overall platform activity.
