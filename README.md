# Re-wear-website
ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange
Develop ReWear, a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The goal is to promote sustainable fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of discarding them.
🌍 About the Project

ReWear offers an eco-friendly way to refresh your wardrobe. Users can list unused clothes and choose between direct swaps or redeeming them through a credit system. The platform promotes responsible consumption while making fashion accessible and sustainable.
